# 20-20-20

An app that forces you every **20 minutes** to look at something **20 feet** away for **20 seconds**

This should help you not become short sighted from spending too much time looking at something a few centimeters away

First you get a 3 second warning, so that you can for example have time to pause a video your watching

Then you get the full screen, always on top 20 second timer

When the 20 second timer ends there's a nice little sound effect

You can press Alt+F4 or ESC at anytime to close the app

Then the app will sleep for 20 minutes and do this again

Run the `RunOnStartup.bat` to make this app run after you reboot
You can run the `DontRunOnStartup.bat` to stop the app from running after you reboot
You can press `The Windows Logo` + `R` then type `shell:startup` to check if this app runs on startup or not

If you decide that you want to stop the app you can run the StopApp.bat file in the folder you downloaded. This should stop the app from giving you any 20-20-20s anymore. You can make sure that 20-20-20 is not running by using the task manager (Open by searching task manager in the start menu (Click the windows logo)). Search for and select 20-20-20 and click end task

Any feedback would be ***insanely*** appreciated

Thanks
